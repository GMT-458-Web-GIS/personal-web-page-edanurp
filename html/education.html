            <h2>What is Geomatics Engineering?</h2>
            <p>
                Geomatics Engineering, also known as Geospatial Engineering, is a field of engineering focused on the acquisition, analysis, interpretation, distribution, and management of geographic information. Geomatics engineers work with spatial data—data related to the Earth's surface—and use advanced technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, global positioning systems (GPS), and satellite imagery.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Areas of Study</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geographic Information Systems (GIS):</strong> GIS involves the storage, analysis, and visualization of spatial and geographic data, helping in decision-making for various industries like urban planning, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Remote Sensing:</strong> This area focuses on the acquisition of information about the Earth's surface using satellites, drones, and other aerial platforms, allowing the analysis of land use, environmental changes, and disaster monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Positioning System (GPS) & Geodesy:</strong> GPS and geodesy deal with precise positioning and measurements of the Earth, helping in navigation, mapping, and infrastructure development.</li>
                <li><strong>Cartography:</strong> The science and art of map-making. Geomatics engineers create detailed and accurate maps used in various sectors such as transportation, urban planning, and resource management.</li>
                <li><strong>Surveying:</strong> Surveying is one of the most fundamental aspects of geomatics engineering, involving measurements of land and terrain, ensuring accuracy in construction, boundary determination, and land development.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of Geomatics Engineering</h3>
            <p>Geomatics engineers play a crucial role in many fields due to the versatility of geospatial technologies. Some key application areas include:</p>
